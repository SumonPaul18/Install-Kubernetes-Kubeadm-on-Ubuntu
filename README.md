## Introduction
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Roadmap
Our roadmap outlines the key milestones and features planned for this repository:
1. **Q4 2024**: Initial release with basic installation and usage documentation.
2. **Q1 2025**: Add advanced configuration and troubleshooting guides.
3. **Q2 2025**: Include best practices and security guidelines.
4. **Q3 2025**: Expand with tutorials and real-world use cases.

## Definitions
- **Pod**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster.
- **Node**: A worker machine in Kubernetes, which can be a VM or a physical machine.
- **Cluster**: A set of nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
- **Service**: An abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

## Installation Guide
### Install Kubernetes using Kubeadm
Detailed steps on how to install Kubernetes using Kubeadm.

### Install Kubernetes on Ubuntu

## Usage Guide
### Deploying an Application
1. **Create a Deployment**:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```
    Apply the deployment:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

2. **Expose the Deployment**:
    ```sh
    kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --name=nginx-service
    ```

3. **Access the Application**:
    ```sh
    minikube service nginx-service
    ```
